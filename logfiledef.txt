============================ logfiledef.txt =================================
This file defines the columns of data in the low-rate channel-specific log
files produced by the GRID software receiver.  Each log file corresponds to
one channel in the receiver.  At any given time, each active channel tracks a
single signal from a single transmitter (see the list of possible signals in
the .  This means that the log file may record the acquisition of a signal,
track that signal for some time, lose the signal, and subsequently acquire
another different signal.  All of this is recorded in the same log file.

Two types of measurement time stamps are given in each log file.  They both
correspond to the same event: the observables measurement event.

    (1) Raw Receiver Time (RRT): This time stamp is linked directly to the
    receiver's sampling clock.  It starts at zero when the receiver is
    initialized and is never interrupted or adjusted by the code.

    (2) Offset Receiver Time (ORT): This time stamp is equal to RRT plus an
    offset that brings the result close (within a few ms) to true GPS time:

    ORT = RRT + tOffset

    The offset gets periodically adjusted every so often to bring ORT back
    within a few ms of true GPS time.  When the offset is adjusted, a small
    jump in ORT is introduced.  For maximum resolution, ORT is given in
    separate columns for week, whole second, and fractional seconds.

Column              Quantity

1 ----------------- RRT week number.

2 ----------------- RRT seconds of week.

3 ----------------- ORT week number. 

4 ----------------- ORT whole seconds of week.

5 ----------------- ORT fractional second. 

6 ----------------- Apparent Doppler frequency in Hz (positive for
                    approaching SVs).

7 ----------------- Beat carrier phase in cycles (changes in the same sense as
                    pseudorange).

8 ----------------- Pseudorange in meters.

9 ----------------- Carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0) in dB-Hz.

10 ---------------- Flag indicating whether (1) or not (0) the pseudorange and
                    carrier phase measurements are valid.

11 ---------------- A flag indicating whether (1) or not (0) an anomaly has
                    been detected in the PLL's phase tracking error.  By
                    anomaly is meant a carrier cycle slip or unusually large
                    phase error.  Phase measurements should be regarded with
                    distrust if this flag is asserted.

12 ---------------- Channel status indicator:
                    0       STATUS_NULL
                    1       STATUS_ALLOCATED
                    2       STATUS_ACQUIRED
                    3       STATUS_SYMBOL_LOCK
                    4       STATUS_FREQ_LOCK
                    5       STATUS_PHASE_LOCK
                    6       STATUS_DATA_LOCK

13 ---------------- Signal type:
                    0       GPS_L1_CA       // GPS L1 legacy civil code 
                    1       GPS_L2_CM       // GPS L2 civil M code
                    2       GPS_L2_CL       // GPS L2 civil L code
                    3       GPS_L2_CLM      // GPS L2 M+L combined tracking 
                    4       GPS_L5_I        // GPS L5 civil in-phase
                    5       GPS_L5_Q        // GPS L5 civil quadrature
                    6       GPS_L5_IQ       // GPS L5 civil I+Q combined tracking
                    7       GPS_L1_CA_ALT1  // GPS L1 C/A for alternative L1C bank
                    8       CDMA_UHF_PILOT  // Cellular CDMA pilot, I+Q signal
                    9       CDMA_UHF_SYNC   // Cellular CDMA pilot+sync, I+Q signal

14 ---------------- Space vehicle identification number (SVID).
